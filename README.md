# Basics with formula.
1. Basic introduction of outliers.
2. How to calculate 5 Number Summary.
3. How to calculate IQR.
4. How to calculate inner and outer bracket.

# Python implementation.
Steps we followed here:
1. Importing data
2. Creating pivot table which contains "Number"
3. Box plot to find outliers.
4. Describe "Number" by using pandas function ".describe()"
5. Find the q1,q2 which is 25% and 75%.
6. Find IQR.
7. Calculating lower bracket and upper bracket.
8. Filtering data to know which are the outliers.
9. Remove the outliers and store in a veriable.

# key point
*Remember this is not only step to find outliers.
